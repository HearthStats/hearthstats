A ruby translation project managed on [Locale](http://www.localeapp.com/) that's open to all!

## Contributing to hearthstats

- Edit the translations directly on the [hearthstats](http://www.localeapp.com/projects/public?search=hearthstats) project on Locale.
- **That's it!**
- The maintainer will then pull translations from the Locale project and push to Github.

Happy translating!
